## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Chandra Shekhar Singh Rajput, over 9+ years of experience in Java Integration development.

👨‍💻 I enjoy designing and deploying production-ready end to end architecture for Java EE, Spring Boot, and Microservices.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from **swimming**, **horse riding**.

✈️ I love **travelling** as well.
